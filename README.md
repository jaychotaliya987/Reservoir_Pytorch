# Reservoir_PyTorch

This repository is dedicated to preparing a project that involves running a reservoir computing model across multiple machines. The goal is to potentially reduce the memory requirements of reservoir computing.

Please note that this repository serves primarily as a personal learning and exploration space. It is unlikely to provide significant benefits to others. It will be used to track my learning progress and may include initial work.

Additionally, I plan to create some small projects with convolutional neural networks using PyTorch here.
